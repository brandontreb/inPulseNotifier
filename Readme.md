# About #

inPulseNotifier is a Mobile Substrate hack that intercepts all iOS local, push, calendar, and SMS notifications and sends them to an [inPulse Watch](http://getinpulse.com).  It uses the amazing BTStack to interface with the watch and was created using [theos](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Getting_Started).

InPulseNotifier requires a jailbroken iPhone running iOS 4.3 or higher since Apple doesn't support the kind of trickery used in this application.

# Set up #

At the moment, I'm too lazy to write this part.  Please refer to the [set up instructions](https://github.com/peterhajas/MobileNotifier/blob/master/Readme.md) of the amazing [Peter Hajas](http://twitter.com/peterhajas) of [mobile notifier](http://www.peterhajas.com/blog/2011/2/27/mobilenotifier-beta3-copious-corn-flakes-1.html).  The set up is pretty much identical.

[Peter Hajas](http://twitter.com/peterhajas) was incredible for open sourcing mobile notifier, which I pretty much just jacked a lot of his logic for the notification interception.  He's also very responsive on Twitter and tolerated my dumb questions.

[Dustin Howett](howett.net) is the man!  He wrote theos and provided TONS of support in IRC.

[Dr. sc. Matthias Ringwald](http://keyboard.ringwald.ch/Welcome.html) created BTStack and helped me quite a bit on IRC as well. And I jacked some of his BT interface code.

[Eric from inPulse](http://getinpulse.com) was super responsive in answering all of my watch related questions.
